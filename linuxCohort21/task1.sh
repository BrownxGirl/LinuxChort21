Task 1
1) ls - I see a list of files. This means that the ls command reflects the list of commands within the current directory

2)pwd - I see /home/recruits. This means that the pwd command reflects the current working directory that the terminal is in.

3)recruits@recruits-All-Series:~$ mkdir workspace
recruits@recruits-All-Series:~$ cd workspace
recruits@recruits-All-Series:~/workspace$
 
4)When the ls command is typed within the workspace directory nothing is reflected, this means that there are no files within the Workspace directory.

5)recruits@recruits-All-Series:~/workspace$ touch README.md
recruits@recruits-All-Series:~/workspace$ ls
README.md

6)recruits@recruits-All-Series:~/workspace$ cp README.md CHANGELOG.md
recruits@recruits-All-Series:~/workspace$ ls
CHANGELOG.md  README.md
