I've been a prisoner in the deafening silence of my mind 
A shadow of a person who once lived
But never fully or completely.

I've been a thief
Robbing myself of the happiness and success my life could give me in any given moment

Being trapped in the realms of 'could've' and 'might've beens''
A life in the presence of a past that never happened and a future that will never become the present .

I've been thinking
My head fills heavy and airy
As if pressure is holding back the nightmares from running wild inside my head
Insanity cripples me 
The fear drowns me in an ocean of doubt and rejection.

I'm many things
A coward is one of them
I'm too scared to look at you in the eye, 
Too afraid to stare at my own reflection to see what my eyes hold
Is it anger?
Hatred?
Regret?
Maybe...
But maybe it holds... nothing
An emptiness that will mock me even in the quietness of deep sleep.


She's awakening 
Her thoughts spinning into the present
Her body is stilling
The monsters in her head are returning to the shadows
They there , watching but for now the remain unseen
But present.
She's turning
In her sleep there isn't peace
A large part of her feels deceased
Her spirit isn't at ease
A segment of her is crumpling
Her foundation is shaking
Cracking
But somehow it still remains
